			This is IMGMI, a no frills image uploading service.  You don't need an account, you don't need to see ads, all you need is images.
			<br /><br />I've had to deal with plenty of these so called &quot;great&quot; image upload services, frankly I have liked none of them. From spamming ads to slow response times, it just annoys me. This is IMGMI, a simple clean image uploading service.
			<br /><br />Please if you want to, just <span onclick="this.innerHTML='adam [AT] imgmi.net';">drop me a line</span>.
